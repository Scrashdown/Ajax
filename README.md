# Virtual Reality Final Project
By Lo√Øc Droz and Rodrigo Granja

We developped this project in the context of our Virtual Reality Master Course at EPFL Switzerland. We designed and implemented a VR experience where users use their hands as controllers. Demo video can be found at : https://youtu.be/fLKtYcRsLYM. We used an Oculus Rift as our VR headset paired with a Leap Motion camera for hand tracking purposes.
